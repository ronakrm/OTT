A majority of this codebase was adapted from (https://github.com/Tuyki/TT_RNN)[https://github.com/Tuyki/TT_RNN]. Scripts within the Datasets folder are for processing data directly downloaded from the Hollywood2 main website (https://www.di.ens.fr/~laptev/actions/hollywood2/)[https://www.di.ens.fr/~laptev/actions/hollywood2/]. Videos were scaled down using ffmpeg, with no other preprocessing.
