# Orthogonal Tensor Trains (OTT)

Various implementations for the experiments in the paper below. Simulations and moving MNIST include Tensorflow implementations, while Hollywood2 and Neuroimaging experiments were conducted using PyTorch.

Some details (re: neuroimaging data) have been omitted.

## Dependencies

Works with Tensorflow 1.12 and 1.14. Pytorch 1.0.1 was used for neuroimaging experiments.
Keras 2.1.2 (with TF 1.12) was used for Hollywood2 experiments.
